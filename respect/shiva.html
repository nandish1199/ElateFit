            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p> <b> &nbsp; Q: Who is Mahadev?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The world remembers only those greatest teachers who concurred the near impossible task that is
                    controlling the mind completely,
                    and also helped others by their magnificent teachings to concur the mind (Chitta). I bow down to
                    the greatest teacher Adiyogi.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The entire Universe will destroy, the entire living beings will die and ultimately their existence 
                        will become false, but the only Purusha who is unaffected from birth and death is lord Shiva who will
                        stay forever, that's why we call him as the Beautiful Truth that never fades.
                        <b>(Satyam Shivam Sundaram)</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shiva is the first yogi who taught us how to take control over our mind completely
                through yogic practices,
                Hence we call him as <b>Adiyogi (The first yogi)</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shiva is <b>Nirgun</b>, which means his chitta(mind) is neither distracted from 
                good things nor from bad things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shiva is called as <b>Chidananda</b>, which means he reached the state of <b>Nirvikalpa Samadhi</b>
                 where nothing in this entire universe can make
                him sad, he always stays in equanimous state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Nirvakalpa Samadhi</b> the last stage of yoga, if a yogi reaches this stage then he realizes that 
                he is Shiva himself, hence, Shiva is everywhere every living being every minute particle in the entire universe is
                the Shiva's creation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shiva taught us <b>Hathayoga,</b> <b>Rajayoga</b> the two beautiful ways where a yogi can take control 
                over their mind completely, to reach equilibrium or to attain salvation and to get rid of the 
                birth and death cycle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Hathayoga:</b> Taking control over mind(getting rid of all the thoughts from the mind) through retention of breath(Pranayama).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rajayoga:</b> Taking control over mind(getting rid of all the thoughts from the mind) through gazing(linga yoga or shivayoga).
                </li>
                <li>
                    All the praising words from all the languages
                combined together will be less to praise our lord Shiva.
                </li>
                I have given the best possible brief information about the Adiyogi from the little knowledge I had about Adiyogi,
                     Please forgive me if I am wrong, or you can give me suggestions at what extent I can improve.
                 I have a great respect towards Adiyogi, His teachings will always stay in my heart, I am always grateful to 
                 Adiyogi because of his excellent teachings.
            </ul>
