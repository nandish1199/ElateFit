            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p><b> &nbsp; Q: Who is Sarvajna?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The world remembers only those greatest teachers who concurred the near impossible task that is
                    controlling the mind completely,
                    and also helped others by their magnificent teachings to concur the mind (Chitta). I bow down to
                    the greatest teacher Sarvajna.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sarvajna the name is given by the people who stayed closed to him. Sarvajana means the person who know everything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sarvajna given the knowledge on Good Ethics, Yoga, Hathayoga, Rajayoga, Politics, Health,
                    Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Metallurgy, Botany, Astrophysics, Psychology, Mathematics, Finance and many more
                    that's why people call him as Sarvajna(The person who knew everything).
                </li>
                <li>
                    My respect got doubled when I got to know the simple living of Sarvajna, The person who knew everything
                    could lead a luxurious life but, Sarvajna lived so simple life that he only had a bowl from which he can 
                    eat and a simple dress to wear. All the praising words from all the languages
                    combined together will be less to praise Sarvajna. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sarvajna's teachings are easy to understand and quick to grasp. Within an hour you will learn
                    thousands of great teachings given by Sarvajna.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sarvajna teachings are short, precise, straight forward, and stays in our mind forever. Sarvajna 
                    given the greatest knowledge only within 3 lines they are called as Tripadi. All teachings of Sarvajna
                    are exactly in three lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sarvajna is from Karnataka India, his teachings are extraordinary, Excellent, Magnificent. I am really 
                    sad to say that Sarvajna teachings are not available in all other languages. I don't know why people 
                    don't translate these excellent teachings to other languages that are very precise and quick to learn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please read the teachings of Sarvajna I am 100% sure you will also become a follower of Sarvajana within 
                    minutes. 
                </li>
                I have given the best possible brief information about the great yogi Sarvajna from the little knowledge I had about Sarvajna,
                     Please forgive me if I am wrong, or you can give me suggestions at what extent I can improve.
                 I have a great respect towards Sarvajna, His teachings will always stay in my heart, I am always grateful to 
                 Lord Sarvajna because of his excellent teachings.
