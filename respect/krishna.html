            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p><b>Q: Who is Yogiraj Krishna?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The world remembers only those greatest teachers who concurred the near impossible task that is
                    controlling the mind completely,
                    and also helped others by their magnificent teachings to concur the mind (Chitta). I bow down to
                    the greatest teacher Krishna.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Krishna is also called as Yogiraj Krishna because he reached the last stage of yoga which is
                    Nirvikalpa Samadhi, where, Even the greatest disasters cannot disturb his state of mind (Chitta). Krishna always
                    stay in the equanimous state. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Krishna taught us the excellent teachings on yoga through Bhagavadgita, krishna told everyone to become 
                    nirgun that is the way to attain salvation. I highly recommend everyone
                    to read Bhagadvadgita.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Krishna given importance to karma(work) the actions are the reflections of individuals success.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Krishna gave more importance to yoga, and he taught all knowledge required to control
                    the mind(Chitta) through certain yogic techniques such as gazing(trataka) and Pranayam(retention of breath).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Krishna taught us that the yoga is the only way to control our mind.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All the praising words from all the languages
                    combined together will be less to praise our Krishna.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am happy to say that Krishna's teachings are spread across the world, everyone know Krishna, everyone love Krishna
                    Everyone follow Krishna. Krishnas teachings are available in all the languages.
                </li>
                I have given the best possible brief information about Krishna from the little knowledge I had about Krishna,
                     Please forgive me if I am wrong, or you can give me suggestions at what extent I can improve.
                 I have a great respect towards Krishna, His teachings will always stay in my heart, I am always grateful to 
                 Krishna because of his excellent teachings.
                
            </ul>
