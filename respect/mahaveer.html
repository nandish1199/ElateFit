            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p><b>Q: Who is Mahaveer?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The world remembers only those greatest teachers who concurred the near impossible task that is
                    controlling the mind completely,
                    and also helped others by their magnificent teachings to concur the mind (Chitta). I bow down to
                    the greatest teacher Lord Mahaveer.
                </li>
                <li>Mahaveer got the Salvation(Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Thoughtless Ultimate Bliss) after 12 years of tapas(Yoga). </li>
                <li>There is a saying in India those who concur the world we call him as Veer(warrior)
                    and those who concur themselves we call him as MahaVeer(The Ultimate Warrior). There is no 
                    superior warrior beyond.
                </li>
                <li>Mahaveer is one of the great yogi who attained complete knowledge on everything.</li>
                <li>
                    Mahaveer encouraged Satya(Truthfulness), Ahimsa (Non-Violence), Astaya (Non-stealing),
                    Brahmacharya (Chastity), Aparigraha (Non Attachment).
                </li>
                <li>Being a Prince he could have enjoyed the materialistic world, But Mahaveer choose
                    the Sanyasa and given the best example to the world that yogic path is the blissful path and
                    Materialistic world is full of sorrows that will never end.
                </li>
                <li>Mahaveer taught the discipline to the entire world to lead happy and non-violence life.</li>
                <li>Mahaveer is also called as the Jin(The person who took control over all his senses). </li>
                <li>
                    All the praising words from all the languages
                combined together will be less to praise our lord Mahaveer.
                </li>
                I have given the best possible brief information about the great yogi Mahaveer from the little knowledge I had about Mahaveer,
                     Please forgive me if I am wrong, or you can give me suggestions at what extent I can improve.
                 I have a great respect towards Mahaveer, His teachings will always stay in my heart, I am always grateful to 
                 Lord Mahaveer because of his excellent teachings.
            </ul>
