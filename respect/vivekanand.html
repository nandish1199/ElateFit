            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p><b> &nbsp; Q: Who is Swami Vivekananda?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The world remembers only those greatest teachers who concurred the near impossible task that is
                    controlling the mind completely,
                    and also helped others by their magnificent teachings to concur the mind (Chitta). I bow down to
                    the greatest teacher Vivekananda.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have you heard of the Beautiful quote "Strength is life weakness is death"? That is 
                    given by Swami Vivekananda.
                </li>
                <li>Have you heard of great scientist Nicolas Tesla? And Subhas Chandra Bose? They are 
                    the followers of Swami Vivekananda.
                </li>
                <li>Swami Vivekananda given more importance to the work. He also believed that work can only 
                    give success and salvation in one's life.
                </li>
                <li>The real name of Swami Vivekananda is Narendra, the name Swami Vivekananda is given by the people 
                    who followed him. Vivekananda means (Vivek= Knowledge + Ananda= Bliss).
                </li>
                <li>Swami Vivekananda was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission, to teach Karma Yoga to the entire world.</li>
                <li>Swami Vivekananda given the accurate knowledge to the world on self realization and eradicated most of the 
                    superstitious beliefs from the society.
                </li>
                I have given the best possible brief information about the Swami Vivekananda from the little knowledge I had about Swami Vivekananda,
                     Please forgive me if I am wrong, or you can give me suggestions at what extent I can improve.
                 I have a great respect towards Swami Vivekananda, His teachings will always stay in my heart, I am always grateful to 
                 Swami Vivekananda because of his excellent teachings.
