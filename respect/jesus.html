            <h2>DECRIPTION</h2>
            <p><b> &nbsp; Q: Who is Lord Jesus?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The world remembers only those greatest teachers who concurred the near impossible task that is
                    controlling the mind completely,
                    and also helped others by their magnificent teachings to concur the mind (Chitta). I bow down to
                    the greatest teacher Lord Jesus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The only one in the entire history who blessed even those who are killing him. That is 
                    Jesus. This is the highest level of kindness in the entire history.
                </li>
                <li> All the praising words from all the languages
                    combined together will be less to praise our lord Jesus.</li>
                <li>Staying close to the society Jesus taught the way to lead peaceful life and the rules to lead a happy life to the 
                    entire world.
                </li>
                <li>The person who concur the entire world we call him as warrior, But the person who concur himself
                    we call him as the ultimate warrior, there is no superior warrior in the entire universe that can even stand before the person who 
                    concurred himself. Lord Jesus was the one who concurred himself (who took control over his mind completely) 
                    that even he blessed those who are killing him.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Lord Jesus eradicated all the superstitious beliefs that the people across the world were following blindly,
                     and given the correct(accurate) knowledge to the people to attain Salvation through Bible to the entire world.
                 </li>
                 <li>The Bible the holy book teach us the way to lead a happy and merciful life. That ultimately take us 
                     towards Salvation(Nirvikalpa Samadhi). I highly recommend you to please read Bible which will
                    help you to lead successful and compassionate life.
                 </li>
                 <li>Lord Jesus taught the entire world that, taking control over mind must be the ultimate goal of every human 
                     being only then one will be freed from all sorrows.
                 </li>
                 <li>Lord Jesus given the excellent knowledge to the entire world through Bible, even the gold and the precious gems 
                     in the entire universe combined together are worthless before Bible.
                 </li>
                 I have given the best possible brief information about Lord Jesus from the little knowledge I had about Jesus,
                     Please forgive me if I am wrong, or you can give me suggestions at what extent I can improve.
                 I have a great respect towards Lord Jesus, His teachings will always stay in my heart, I am always grateful to 
                 Lord Jesus because of his excellent teachings.
